# Build an Application using Make
Write a HTTP web server written in the Golang language that listen to incoming HTTP requests on localhost:9999.


## Prerequisites
- Golang in v1.15.*
- NPM v7+ with NodeJS v14.* (stable)
- Python 3 with pip module
- golangci-lint
- yq v4.5.0
- shellcheck v0.*
- yamllint v1.*
- jq v1.*


## Requirements
You are expected to write a `Makefile` to automate the life-cycle of this application:
- A `Makefile` should be present and valid
- The binary `awesome-api` must NOT exist at the beginning, in the source code
- The goals `build`, `run` , `stop`, `clean` test should be implemented and mapped to the life-cycle stages of the same name
- A Valid Go-Hugo website is provided (in your cohort’s slack channel).
- There are no Git Submodules
- The theme ananke is installed
- The file ./github-workflow.yml must be a symbolic link to the original file <...>/.github/workflows/module3_task2.yml


## Lifecycle
- “build”: Generate a website and an API application.
- “run”: Run the application in background by executing the binary `awesome-api`, and write logs into a file named `awesome-api.log` with the command `./awesome-api >./awesome-api.log 2>&1 &`.
- “stop”: Stop the application with the command `kill XXXXX` where `XXXXX` is the Process ID of the application. For instance: `kill "$(pgrep awesome-api)"`
- “clean”: Cleanup the content of the directory `dist/` and stop the application with the command `kill XXXXX` where `XXXXX` is the Process ID of the application. For instance: `kill "$(pgrep awesome-api)"` and stop the application. Delete the binary `awesome-api` and the log file `awesome-api.log`.
- “post”: Create a new blog post whose filename and title come from the environment variables `POST_TITLE` and `POST_NAME`.
- “help”: Prints out the list of targets and their usage
- “test”: You want to test it to ensure that it behaves as expected. With the application started, you may want to use the command line `curl` (or your web browser, or the command `wget` or any other HTTP client):
- “lint”: Does the linting of the program using golangci-lint
- “unit-tests”: Execute (successfully) the Golang unit tests
- “integration-tests”: Execute (successfully) the Golang integration tests
- “check”: ## Check if there are dead link or a badly written Markdown file
- “validate”: ## look if the generated HTML respects the W3C syntax

## Build Workflow
Create a new workflow named module3_task1 with only the following steps:
- Clone the repository,
- Use ubuntu-22.04 as the virtual machine.
- Always run the make target package
- Position yourself in the correct directory and execute the command make help to validate that the Makefile is present and implements the help and build targets.

This workflow must be triggered:
- Generate a changelog based on the merged Pull Request’s titles, since the previous release
- Create a release with the archive and content of DEPLOY.md when triggered by a tag
- Behave the same as “module3_task2” when triggered by something else than a tag (e.g. archive without version name, and no release)
- Be enabled in GitHub Actions and must have been run successfully with a tag 1.0.0
